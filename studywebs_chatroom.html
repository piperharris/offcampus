        <h1>About us!</h1>&nbsp;
        <h3>Welcome to the Off-Campus experience</h3>&nbsp;
        <p>We all love to experience the aura that our campus life offers us. The blend of well-designed lecture
          theatres, the courtyard’s rejuvenating sunlight, the library’s quiet space, and the cozy cafeterias all make
          our campus experience priceless. Engaging ourselves in the learning-focused ambience of lecture rooms,
          studying in the uninterrupted atmosphere of library rooms, sharing the experience of discussing academic
          lessons and world affairs over a cup of coffee in the cafeteria with the peers, all these experiences create a
          lifetime impression on us and we hold on to these memories forever.</p>&nbsp;

        <p>In this pandemic context, staying healthy and safe is a stroke of luck. The situation has bound us to
          continue our normal activities while staying in the safe atmosphere of our home. However, it is undeniable
          that we are missing out on priceless experiences. Hence it was to simulate these experiences that we gained
          the motivation for building this project. If we can assist you to feel the aura of campus life while sitting
          at home, just with a device and browsing a website on the internet, it will be fairly remunerating. The
          background noises on our website are based on the different uni-style rooms and their relevant background
          images, in addition to features like a to-do list which gives you the option to list down all the activities
          you want to complete. Moreover, playlists will be used to put you in the right mood for your work/study
          /relaxation, and all these features will aim to boost up your spirit amidst the difficult times we all are
          going through.</p>&nbsp;
